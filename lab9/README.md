# Report of the 9th Laboratory

## Description
In this paper, shooting and quasi-linear methods are used to solve the boundary value problem. And the solution of the problem with periodic solutions is also considered. The three-point run method, also known as the Thomas method, is used to solve the problems for periodic solutions and for quasi-linear method.

## Shooting method

## Quasi-linearization method

## Tridiagonal matrix algorithm
